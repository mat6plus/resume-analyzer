1. I want to adjust the model of the web app. It should take the Company Name, Job Name, and Job Description.
2. I will need to readjust the tasks.py file such that It only analysis the supplied job description against the content of the uploaded resume.
3. The resume should be in either PDF or .doc, .docx etc. Any other format is not acceptable.
4. I will need the task to decode the Resume and the supplied job description and analyze it with a percentage match and also word suggestions that can be added to the resume to make it a goof fit for the job it's analyzing.
5. After all the analysis, it displays all of the necessary to help the user make informed decision.
6. Subsquently I will like it to generate a cover letter based on the whole analysis and where the match percentage is very low, we can suggest a resume re-write with the aid of any of the top Ai models via API.
7. The whole essence of this system is to act like a Application Tracking System yet a resume analyzer.
8. If I will be considering using OpenSource Ai solution, how will i go about hosting a copy of it or I will be able to access it via an API.
